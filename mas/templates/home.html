			Introduction
		</div>
		<div class="mui-divider"></div>
		<p>
		Welcome to our final project for the <em>Multi-Agent Systems</em>
		course. Here we describe and analyse the well-known classical game of
		<em>Guess Who?</em> with the use of <em>epistemic logic</em>.   
		</p>

		<p>
		The game of <em>Guess Who?</em> is played by two players, who each have
		to <em>guess</em> the identity of the opposing player. Before the game
		starts both players pick a character from a set of 24 character cards
		to represent them. Each character exhibits different traits. The goal
		of the game is to figure out which of the characters the other player
		has picked, the first player to do so wins the game. Players alternate
		asking the other player <em>'yes'</em> or <em>'no'</em> questions about
		which traits their character possesses. Players are also always allowed
		to directly guess what the identity of their opponent is.
		</p>

		<p>
		For this project we simplify the game by focussing on four different
		character traits: whether the person has a <em>beard</em>,
		<em>moustache</em>, <em>glasses</em> and whether the person is
		<em>bald</em>. For each trait we choose two characters who exhibited a
		given trait, which led to a total of six characters. A version of this 
		game, along with knowledge representations for both the player and NPC, 
		can be found on the <em>play page</em>.
		</p>

		<div class="mui--text-dark-secondary mui--text-title">Characters</div>

		<p>
		The characters that we choose were David, Frans, Max, Paul, Richard and
		Sam. Their character cards are depicted here.
		</p>

		<p style="text-align:center;">

		<img src="{% static 'Richard.png' %}" alt="Richard">
		<img src="{% static 'Sam.png' %}" alt="Sam">
		</p>

		<p>
		When looking at the character traits we can see that Frans is the only
		person not exhibiting any of the traits, while Richard is the only one
		possessing three out of four traits. David, Max and Paul exhibit only
		one trait and Sam is the only person with two traits.
		</p>

		<p style="text-align:center;"><img src="{% static 'Traits.png' %}" alt="Character traits"></p>

		<div class="mui--text-dark-secondary mui--text-title">Knowledge</div>
		<p>
		The knowledge of the players throughout the game can be expressed
		through the use of various Kripke models. A Kripke model is a structure 
		of nodes, of which each represent a possible world. Here, a world 
		contains the proposition that a particular character is the identity of 
		the opponent. The relations between the worlds represent the knowledge 
		of a particular agent (the player or NPC) about these propositions. A 
		relation between two nodes signifies that the agent is not sure about 
		the world that they are in, since the identity of the opponent is still 
		not certain. The answers to the questions that each player can ask can 
		be seen as public announcements, which would lead to reduced knowledge 
		models. At the start of each game, a player's knowledge about the 
		identity of his opponent can be modelled as follows:
		</p>

		<p style="text-align:center;"><img src="{% static 'Kripke0.png' %}" alt="Default Kripke model"></p>

		<p>
		In these Kripke models the states represent the characters in the game, 
		with their respective traits being represented by propositions. If 
		<em>bald</em> holds in a specific state, it means that the associated 
		character is in fact bald. Likewise, if <em>glasses</em>,<em>beard</em> 
		and <em>moustache</em> hold, the character also wears glasses and has a 
		beard and moustache.
		</p>

		<p>
		In order to illustrate the dynamic aspect of the model we can look
		at the following example. Take the identity of our opponent to be Sam.
		Note that the following example only shows the knowledge about the
		opponents identity. A complete game would also require a model for the
		knowledge about your own character.
		</p>

		<p>
		We can ask whether the person has a moustache. Assuming that the
		opponent is truthful, he or she would respond with <em>'no'</em>. Since
		we now know that the character does not have a moustache, we now also
		know that Max and Richard cannot be the identity of the opponent. This
		leads to the updated Kripke model:
		</p>

		<p style="text-align:center;"><img src="{% static 'Kripke1.png' %}" alt="Updated Kripke model after 1 question"></p>

		<p>
		We know that David, Sam, Frans and Paul are still viable
		alternatives. To further decrease the options we can ask whether the
		person wears glasses, to which the opponent responds with
		<em>'yes'</em>. Since we know that <em>glasses</em> holds, we can
		update our model once again:
		</p>

		<p style="text-align:center;"><img src="{% static 'Kripke2.png' %}" alt="Updated Kripke model after 2 question"></p>

		<p>
		It is after this question that we now know that the identity of the
		opponent is either Sam or Paul. We can continue with a third
		question, which would allow for a guaranteed correct identification.
		However, this would take two steps in total. Although we had the option
		throughout the game, directly guessing a character would result in
		either an immediate win (granted that the opponent hasn't guessed your
		identity) or at most two turns.
		</p>

			Strategies
		</div>
		<p>
		Although the game of <em>Guess Who?</em> is not known for its dynamic 
		and complex gameplay, it is possible to use different strategies to win. 
		Since the goal is to discover the identity of your opponent	before your 
		own identity is guessed, the number of steps that you'll need to do so 
		is an important element. This number is largely dependent on the 
		probability of your opponent having picked a particular character, but 
		also on the list of questions that you ask. Based on the list of 
		remaining characters, a particular question can give you a low chance 
		to heavily shorten this list, although this also comes with a high chance 
		of shortening it by only a few characters. Another strategy is to 
		avoid risk by only asking questions that will roughly cut the number of 
		characters in half, without any form of potential punishment. While this 
		would require the player to ask more questions than in the best case 
		scenario for the risk strategy, it would require less than in its worst 
		case.  
		</p>

		<p>
		To investigate these strategies we can look at two decision trees: one 
		being the result of using the save strategy and one for the risk strategy. 
		In both trees the questions and answers are only shown for one player. 
		Additionally, the player starts by asking the question <em>"Does he have 
		a beard?"</em>. Note that these decision trees are for one side of the 
		game only, with the opponents line of questioning left out. 
		</p>
		
		<p>
		As can be seen in the tree below, the first question would result in 
		leaving either 2 possible characters if answered <em>'yes'</em> and 4 
		characters if answered <em>'no'</em>. In the first situation the next 
		question could be either <em>"Is he bald?"</em> or <em>"Does he have a 
		moustache?"</em>, since the question <em>"Does he wear a glasses?"</em> 
		would not lead to any further decrease in options. After the second answer, 
		we would know with certainty what identity our opponent is. To win the game 
		(given that the opponent has yet to guess our identity) we would have to 
		ask <em>"Is your identity NAME?"</em>. If the initial answer was 
		<em>'yes'</em> we would finish in 3 moves. In the second situation the next 
		question has to be <em>"Does he wear a glasses?"</em>, since the answer 
		would always divide the remaining options in two, whereas the other 
		questions would result in a 1 and 3 split (which is the case in the second 
		decision tree). Based on the results from the second question the third 
		question should be <em>"Is he bald"</em> if answered <em>'yes'</em> or 
		<em>"Does he have a moustache"</em> if answered <em>'no'</em>, since other 
		questions would not reduce the number of possibilities at all. This leads 
		to absolute certainty in all remaining cases. Again, after being certain 
		about the identity of the opponent, we have to follow up with the fourth 
		question <em>"Is your identity NAME?"</em>. If the initial answer was 
		<em>'no'</em> we would finish in 4 moves. This shows that in our version 
		of the game there is a 33% chance of finishing with 3 questions and a 66% 
		chance of finishing in 4 questions.
		</p>
		
		<p style="text-align:center;"><img src="{% static 'StrategySafe.png' %}" alt="SafeStrategyBeard?"></p>
		
		<p>
		The second decision tree (seen below) shows that when using the risk 
		strategy the results are similar to that of the safe strategy, with the 
		left side of both trees being equal to each other. However, since we want 
		to ask questions that will potentially shorten the list of characters as 
		much as possible, we can either ask <em>"Is he bald?"</em> or <em>"Does 
		he have a moustache?"</em>. This will lead to 1 remaining option if 
		answered with <em>'yes'</em>. If our second answer is <em>'no'</em> we 
		would have 3 characters remaining. To further decrease our options we can 
		ask either <em>"Does he wear a glasses?"</em> or <em>"Does he have a 
		moustache?"</em> if our previous question was <em>"Is he bald"</em>, else 
		we can ask either <em>"Does he wear a glasses?"</em> or 
		<em>"Is he bald?"</em>. In all cases we would split our options between 
		either 1 or 2 remaining options. With the addition of the question 
		<em>"Is your identity NAME?"</em> we can see that depending on the 
		identity of our opponent we would finish in 3 questions with 50% chance, 
		in 4 questions with a 16.7% chance and in 5 questions with 33.3% chance. 
		</p>
		
		<p style="text-align:center;"><img src="{% static 'StrategyRisk.png' %}" alt="RiskStrategyBeard?"></p>
		
		<p>
		The two trees above show that the risk strategy gives us a higher chance 
		to finish in 3 questions, but at the risk of finishing in 5 questions if 
		we are unlucky. The decision trees are more or less the same for the 
		remaining questions as our starting points, with the same probabilities 
		that we previously found. However, for the question <em>"Is he bald?"</em> 
		only 1 tree is possible with a 50% chance finish in 3 steps, a 16.7% chance 
		in 4 steps and a 33% chance finish in 5 steps (This is because all characters
		with more than two traits are eliminated if answered <em>'no'</em>). As we 
		mentioned earlier, these decision trees reflect only one side of the 
		questions that are asked during the game. Furthermore, the paths that are 
		seen in the trees will not always be followed by players, since at any 
		given point the player can ask <em>"Is your identity NAME?"</em> (assuming 
		it is the player's turn to ask). Risky players could just go through the 
		entire character list, one by one, until the correct character is guessed. 
		This might be a valid tactic in our version of the game, but in the full 
		version, with 24 characters, the player would have to use a different 
		strategy. Another reason why players would divert from the decision trees 
		is the knowledge that we have of other players. Take for example that we 
		know that our opponent is 1 or 2 questions away from guessing our identity, 
		while we still need to ask a few more questions. It would be foolish not to 
		try our luck in directly guessing the identity of our opponent, if we know 
		that we are going to lose.

			Conclusion
		</div>
		<div class="mui-divider"></div>
		<p>
		For this project we analysed an altered version of the game 
		<em>Guess Who?</em>, as well as construct an online playable version 
		using Python. The analysis consisted of using epistemic logic in the form 
		of public announcements and Kripke structures to model the knowledge of 
		players throughout the game. Two types of strategies were discussed with the 
		use of decision trees: A risk strategy, where the player aimed to remove as 
		many characters as possible, as well as a safe strategy, where the player 
		divided his or her options as evenly as possible. The use of asking whether 
		a particular character is the identity of the opponent was also discussed. 
		</p>
		
		<p>
		The use of epistemic logic helped us model a playable version quickly and 
		accurately. With a clear view of what players know about each other, we were		
		able to visualise the options that a player has. Additionally with the use of 
		the strategies discussed, we created a NPC which can ask relevant questions 
		to a certain extend.   
		</p>
		
		<p>
		As we have seen the above analysis allows us to use epistemic logic to
		build and analyze decision trees using different strategies. In stead
		of making a decision tree we can use a Kripke model and logic to decide
		which question to ask/action to take. This can be useful for other
		decision processes that have large and unwieldy decision trees, using a
		Kripke model might prove to be a good alternative here because decisions
		can be made on the fly as the Kripke model gets updated.
		</p>

		<p>
		Future directions for this project are to further visualize the options that 
		the NPC has, since at the current state we can only see the characters options 
		for the player. Further more, there is room for improvement in the behaviour 
		of the NPC, where at a future state players can choose how the opponent should 
		act. However, main direction would be to extend the game to its full state, 
		where the number of characters are increased to 24, as well as the number of 
		traits available. This would result in more types of questions to ask
		and a more complex knowledge model.
