			Introduction
		</div>
		<div class="mui-divider"></div>
		<p>
		Welcome to our final project for the <em>Multi-Agent Systems</em>
		course. Here we describe and analyse the well-known classical game of
		<em>Guess Who?</em> with the use of <em>epistemic logic</em>. 
		</p>

		<p>
		The game of <em>Guess Who?</em> is played by two players, who each have
		to <em>guess</em> the identity of the opposing player. Before the game
		starts both players pick a character from a set of 24 character cards
		to represent them. Each character exhibits different traits. The goal
		of the game is to figure out which of the characters the other player
		has picked, the first player to do so wins the game. Players alternate
		asking the other player <em>'yes'</em> or <em>'no'</em> questions about
		which traits their character possesses. Players are also always allowed
		to directly guess what the identity of their opponent is.
		</p>

		<p>
		For this project we simplify the game by focussing on four different
		character traits: whether the person has a <em>beard</em>,
		<em>moustache</em>, <em>glasses</em> and whether the person is
		<em>bald</em>. For each trait we choose two characters who exhibited a
		given trait, which led to a total of six characters.
		</p>

		<div class="mui--text-dark-secondary mui--text-title">Characters</div>

		<p>
		The characters that we choose were David, Frans, Max, Paul, Richard and
		Sam. Their character cards are depicted here.
		</p>

		<img src="{% static 'Richard.png' %}" alt="Richard">
		<img src="{% static 'Sam.png' %}" alt="Sam">
		</p>

		<p>
		When looking at the character traits we can see that Frans is the only
		person not exhibiting any of the traits, while Richard is the only one
		possessing three out of four traits. David, Max and Paul exhibit only
		one trait and Sam is the only person with two traits.
		</p>

		<p style="text-align:center;"><img src="{% static 'Traits.png' %}" alt="Character traits"></p>

		<div class="mui--text-dark-secondary mui--text-title">Knowledge</div>
		<p>
		The knowledge of the players throughout the game can be expressed
		through the use of various Kripke models. The answers to the questions
		can be seen as public announcements which would lead to reduced
		knowledge models. At the start of each game, a player's knowledge about
		the identity of his opponent can be modeled as follows:
		</p>

		<p style="text-align:center;"><img src="{% static 'Kripke0.png' %}" alt="Default Kripke model"></p>

		<p>
		In these Kripke models the states represent the characters in the game, with their respective traits 
		being represented by propositions. If <em>bald</em> holds in a specific state, it means that the 
		associated character is in fact bald. Likewise, if <em>glasses</em>,<em>beard</em> and 
		<em>moustache</em> hold, the character also wears glasses and has a beard and moustache.
		</p>

		<p>In order to illustrate the dynamic aspect of the model we can look
		at the following example. Take the identity of our opponent to be Sam.
		Note that the following example only shows the knowledge about the
		opponents identity. A complete game would also require a model for the
		knowledge about your own character.</p>

		<p>
		We can ask whether the person has a moustache. Assuming that the
		opponent is truthful, he or she would respond with <em>'no'</em>. Since
		we now know that the character does not have a moustache, we now also
		know that Max and Richard cannot be the identity of the opponent. This
		leads to the updated Kripke model:
		</p>

		<p style="text-align:center;"><img src="{% static 'Kripke1.png' %}" alt="Updated Kripke model after 1 question"></p>

		<p>We know that David, Sam, Frans and Paul are still viable
		alternatives. To further decrease the options we can ask whether the
		person wears glasses, to which the opponent responds with
		<em>'yes'</em>. Since we know that <em>glasses</em> holds, we can
		update our model once again:</p>

		<p style="text-align:center;"><img src="{% static 'Kripke2.png' %}" alt="Updated Kripke model after 2 question"></p>

		<p>
		It is after this question that we now know that the identity of the
		opponent is either Sam or Paul. We can ofcourse continue with a third
		question, which would allow for a guaranteed correct identification.
		However, this would take two steps in total. Although we had the option
		throughout the game, directly guessing a character would result in
		either an immediate win (granted that the opponent hasn't guessed your
		identity) or at most two turns.
		</p>

		<div class="mui--text-dark-secondary mui--text-title">Strategies</div>
		<p>
		Although the game of <em>Guess Who?</em> is not known for its dynamic 
		and complex gameplay, it is possible to use different strategies to win. 
		Since the goal is to discover the identity of your opponent before your 
		own identity is guessed, the number of steps that you'll need to do so 
		is an important element. This number is largely dependent on the 
		probability of your opponent having picked a particular character, but 
		also on the list of questions that you ask. Based on the list of 
		remaining characters, a particular question can give you a low chance 
		to heavily shorten this list, although this also comes with a high chance 
		of only shortening the list by a few characters. Another strategy is to 
		avoid risk and only ask questions that will roughly cut the number of 
		characters in half, without any form of potential punishment. While this 
		would require the player to ask more questions than in the best case 
		scenario for the risk strategy, it would require less than in its worst 
		case.  
		</p>

		<p>
		To investigate these strategies we can look at risk/safe
